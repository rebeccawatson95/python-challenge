I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. I was given a set of financial data, which is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
