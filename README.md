Throughout this assignment, I had to learn and figure out how to create loops. Loops have been very hard for me to figure out. I realized that you need to set baseline values for things you'll be counting. Then the trick is to read through the csv to add up values. Another thing I realize is how nice tools like Pandas is in assignments or projects like this!
